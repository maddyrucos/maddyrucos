# Hello! I'm Igor 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a **Python / Backend / ML engineer** focused on building **AI-driven systems**, scalable backend services, and production-ready pipelines. My work spans from classic web development to **high-load async systems** and **LLM-based agents**.

Here you’ll find projects related to machine learning, AI agents, backend services, and infrastructure.

## 🔹 Core Focus

* **Machine Learning & AI**
* **LLM agents and orchestration**
* **High-load backend systems**
* **Production-ready infrastructure**

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning & AI

My primary area of focus is **AI/ML development**, including both research and applied engineering:

* **Model training & experimentation**

  * Classical ML and deep learning models
  * Data preprocessing, feature engineering, evaluation

* **LLM-based systems**

  * Design and implementation of **LLM agents**
  * Multi-step reasoning, tools, memory, and workflows
  * Frameworks:

    * **LangChain**
    * **LangGraph**

* **AI pipelines**

  * Asynchronous processing
  * Task orchestration
  * Integration with external APIs and services

## ⚙️ Backend & High-Load Systems

* **Python 3** — primary language
* **Django** — building robust web applications
* **FastAPI** — modern async APIs and microservices
* **RabbitMQ**

  * High-load pipelines
  * Background jobs and message-driven architectures
* **Uvicorn**

  * ASGI servers for async applications
* **REST APIs**

  * API design, authentication, integrations

---

## 🐳 Infrastructure & DevOps

* **Docker**

  * Containerization of services and ML pipelines
* **Docker Compose**

  * Local and staging environments
* **Nginx**

  * Reverse proxy
  * Load balancing
* **HTTPS**

  * Secure data transmission
  * Production deployment practices
